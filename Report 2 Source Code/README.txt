- The Demo section will be used to show the results of our code. It prints 100 images along with their IOU and the segmented results. 

The Annotation file contains the dimensions of the ground truth of the original image.

The Final_traff_sign folder contains all 100 images used in the source code file to be segmented. 

The Gui.py is used to test images from outside datasets.
